## Overview of the analysis
In this analysis, I used Pandas to change the trip duration coumn from integer to a datetime datatype. Additionally, I prepared data visualizations to depict the data in graphs.

## Results
The visualizations show that males ride more bikes compared to females. The peak bike riding day are Thursdays. Also, bike riders are more active between 8am and 5-6pm.

## Summary
In additiion to the visualization that were performed, with the given data set it's also possible to graph the bike check out tiimes of customers versus subscribers in form of a heat map or pie chart. Additionally, a graph could have been created to compare the trip duration of customers vs subscribers.
